## Companion app for the [You are interesting](https://www.youareinteresting.org) project.


The [You are Interesting](https://www.youareinteresting.org) project is an experiment in creating a context for brief, fun conversations with people who are open to connecting with strangers.

You definitely don't need to track metrics to execute on this idea, but if you wanted to, this is the app to do it.

#### It tracks:
* Who is staffing the project at any given time
* What prompts are being offered at the moment
* How many people the staff are connecting with

#### Tracking per conversation:
* The prompt chosen for the conversation
* The length and quality of that connection
* Notes you might want to take about the conversation for later reference

The app is built in [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). It uses google sheets for the persistence layer for this project. Google sheets allows easy access to the data as well opening up ways that the data can by analyized and visualized.
